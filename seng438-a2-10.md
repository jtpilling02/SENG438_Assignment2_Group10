# Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

In this lab session, our team developed our own automated unit tests using a variety of black box strategies. We wrote the test cases using the Java-based tool JUnit and the mocking framework jMock. The System Under Test is a version of JFreeChart framework that has been modified for the purposes of this lab. We based our unit tests on the Javadoc provided with this lab session.

Prior to this lab session, we had very little practical experience with creating our own test cases using JUnit. In addition, we did not have any experience mocking a test case. Overall, this lab has helped us understand the concepts involved with black box testing such as equivalence class and boundary value testing.

  

# Detailed description of Unit Test Strategy <a name="par1"></a>

To begin our design process When designing test cases each of the four members created their own partition for the methods they intended to test, then they were adjusted accordingly after discussion.

  ***Partition One*** was the design strategy used for the methods found in *Range* utilized equivalence class and boundary value testing to determine the test cases to be used. The only required parameters were the values x and y, where x is always less than or equal to y, and y is greater than or equal to x. Due to this, the range was partitioned into a minimum and maximum value (the largest value for an integer, both negative and positive), negative numbers, positive numbers, and zero.


*Data Utilities* had multiple test strategies created for the methods found within. ***Partition Two***, used for calculating row and column totals was created using equivalence class and boundary value testing, and used mockery for their implementation. The range for this partition was split as negative numbers, positive numbers, the minimum and maximum value for an int, and was further split into amounts of columns/rows, and the position of the column/row itself.

***Partition Three*** was written solely for the *getCumulativePercentages()* method, and again used equivalence class and boundary value testing. This method was partitioned into positive numbers and negative numbers, along with also partitioning based on the amount of rows within the table. 

The final strategy, written for ***Partition Four*** used equivalence class and boundary value testing to generate test cases. This was split into testing the creation of arrays, out of bounds arrays, and the lengths of arrays.

# How the Team Work/Effort Was Divided and Managed <a name="par3"></a>

 In order to divide the work within this lab, we split the 10 methods to be tested evenly between the four of us, with two members testing 2 methods each, and the other two members testing 3 methods each. We all decided to create our own partitions for our respective methods. After we had all created the partitions we compared and adjusted based on each other's input to lower the total amount of partitions needed. Finally, after we all made our own test cases, we again shared and checked each other's test cases.

# Difficulties Encountered, Challenges Overcome, and Lessons Learned <a name="par4"></a>

One of the major difficulties that we encountered was the initial concept of mocking. We struggled initially with deciding how to create the mocks, as they were more complex than the tests we needed to design for all of the *Range* methods. The other main challenge we encountered was having our tests that are expected to fail not to have any errors, and only report a failure instead.

When looking back on mocking during a test case, it has many advantages and disadvantages when being used. 

Some advantages of mocking is that they are both fast and stable across systems. Without needing to use external services, the test will always be run the same way and consistency is ensured. Isolation is also a large benefit of mocking, as you can isolate whether the reason behind a failure is due to a dependency. 

The biggest issue with a mock is that we are unable to test the integration between the method we are testing and the component that is mocked. Due to this limitation, we cannot be certain that the method being tested will work. They also may create false-negatives if set up inaccurately.

Through this lab, the largest lesson that we learned was the ability to create our own test cases through the use of the black box strategy. This made us need to think about what the best partition will be, and how to change those to fit the methods we needed to test.

 

# Comments/Feedback on the Lab Itself <a name="par5"></a>

Overall, we found the lab very useful in helping improve our ability to plan test cases from scratch using black box methods, and our ability to create test cases within JUnit. The lab report outline given to us provided us with the necessary structure to ensure that we did not miss any steps during the planning stage, and allowed us to keep consistent between members. As this was most of our group member’s first time using JUnit, this lab taught us a useful skill that will surely assist us as we continue our degrees.
