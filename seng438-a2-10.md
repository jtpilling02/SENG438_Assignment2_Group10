# Detailed description of Unit Test Strategy <a name="par1"></a>

  ***Partition One:*** The design strategy used for the *getCentralRange*, *getUpperBound*, and *getLowerBound* methods found in *Range* utilized equivalence class and boundary value testing to determine the test cases to be used. The only required parameter was values x and y, where x is always less than or equal to y, and y is greater than or equal to x. Due to this, the range was partitioned into a minimum and maximum value (the largest value for an integer, both negative and positive), negative numbers, positive numbers, and zero.

# Test Cases Developed <a name="par2"></a>

The three test cases using ***Partition One*** were *getUpperBound, getLowerBound,* and *getCentralValue*.  There is also one test case for each in which the inputs were invalid.
**getUpperBound**
| Test Method | Input A | Input B
| ----------- | ----------- |  ----------- |
|upperBoundOfNegativePositive()| Negative|Positive |
|upperBoundOfNegativeNegative()|Negative|Negative|
|upperBoundOfPositivePositive()|Positive|Positive|
|upperBoundOfTheSameNumber()|Equals B|Equals A|
|upperBoundOfPositiveMax()|Biggest Int|Biggest Int|
|upperBoundOfNegativeMax()|Smallest Int|Smallest Int|
|upperBoundOfNegMaxAndPositive()|Smallest Int|Positive|
|upperBoundOfNegMaxAndNegative()|Smallest Int|Negative|
|upperBoundOfNegMaxAndZero()|Smallest Int|Zero|
|upperBoundOfPosMaxAndPositive()|Positive|Biggest Int|
|upperBoundOfPosMaxAndNegative()|Negative|Biggest Int|
|upperBoundOfPosMaxAndZero()|Zero|Biggest Int|
|upperBoundOfInvalidInputs()|Greater Than A|Less Than B|
**getLowerBound**
| Test Method | Input A | Input B
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |  ----------- |
|lowerBoundOfNegativePositive()| Negative|Positive |
|lowerBoundOfNegativeNegative()|Negative|Negative|
|lowerBoundOfPositivePositive()|Positive|Positive|
|lowerBoundOfTheSameNumber()|Equals B|Equals A|
|lowerBoundOfPositiveMax()|Biggest Int|Biggest Int|
|lowerBoundOfNegativeMax()|Smallest Int|Smallest Int|
|lowerBoundOfNegMaxAndPositive()|Smallest Int|Positive|
|lowerBoundOfNegMaxAndNegative()|Smallest Int|Negative|
|lowerBoundOfNegMaxAndZero()|Smallest Int|Zero|
|lowerBoundOfPosMaxAndPositive()|Positive|Biggest Int|
|lowerBoundOfPosMaxAndNegative()|Negative|Biggest Int|
|lowerBoundOfPosMaxAndZero()|Zero|Biggest Int|
|lowerBoundOfInvalidInputs()|Greater Than A|Less Than B|
**getCentralValue**
| Test Method | Input A | Input B
| ----------- | ----------- |  ----------- |
|centralValueOfNegativePositive()| Negative|Positive |
|centralValueOfNegativeNegative()|Negative|Negative|
|centralValueOfPositivePositive()|Positive|Positive|
|centralValueOfTheSameNumber()|Equals B|Equals A|
|centralValueOfPositiveMax()|Biggest Int|Biggest Int|
|centralValueOfNegativeMax()|Smallest Int|Smallest Int|
|centralValueOfNegMaxAndPositive()|Smallest Int|Positive|
|centralValueOfNegMaxAndNegative()|Smallest Int|Negative|
|centralValueOfNegMaxAndZero()|Smallest Int|Zero|
|centralValueOfPosMaxAndPositive()|Positive|Biggest Int|
|centralValueOfPosMaxAndNegative()|Negative|Biggest Int|
|centralValueOfPosMaxAndZero()|Zero|Biggest Int|
|centralValueOfInvalidInputs()|Greater Than A|Less Than B|


// write down the name of the test methods and classes. Organize the based on

the source code method // they test. identify which tests cover which partitions

you have explained in the test strategy section //above

  

# How the Team Work/Effort Was Divided and Managed <a name="par3"></a>

  In order to divide the work within this lab, we  split the 10 methods to be tested evenly between the four of us, with two members testing 2 methods each, and the other two members testing 3 methods each. We all decided to create our own partitions for our respective methods, then after we had all created the partitions we compared and adjusted based on each others input. Finally after we all made our own test cases, we once again shared and checked each others test cases.
